# Perl

Perl and MyDef has a very special relationship. For one, they share a very similar philosophy; for two, MyDef itself is developed in Perl and all of its internal structure is exposed through Perl. When we later discussing extending MyDef, we can extend MyDef by making more MyDef libraries, or we may have to expand its feature directly in perl.

I will assume you are already familiar with the Perl programming language.
