# Who would benefit from MyDef?

MyDef will benefit programmers who are already experienced with at least one programming language.

MyDef is not intended for novices who are learning how to program. MyDef on its own is not a complete programming language. It is a meta system to facilitate writing and refactoring programs written in a primary language such as C, Perl, PHP, etc. As such, MyDef will not benefit novice programmers who are still struggling with basic programming concept. On the other hand, for experienced programmers, there is often a need beyond getting the code to compile and run. When the programmer is already familiar with the language, the focus shifts to semantics such as algorithms and program structures. At this stage, the low level syntax of the primal language, such as the semicolons, brackets, and even the necessary interface to define and call subroutines can become nuisance in the way of achieving master programmer's vision. If this sounds like a familiar scenario to you, then MyDef is for you!
