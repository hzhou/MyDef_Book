## Structure

"struct" is the next essential C component and it is often quite tedious to maintain. In addition to need to specify both types and names to each of its elements, its member declaration and where it is being used is often forced to be separate, which creates constant need going back and forth. MyDef offers "$struct" syntax to remedy that.
