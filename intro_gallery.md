MyDef is all about flexibility. As such, it is difficult to describe what MyDef is and what it can do. Last section gives a quick glimpse, but may not be enough to persuade you to try MyDef or read the rest of this book, especially if you are not a c programmer, or simply not interested in simple hello world programs. 

In this section, I'll gather some quick examples in various applications and programming languages. Hopefully it will do a better job giving impressions of what MyDef is and what it can help.
