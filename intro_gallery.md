MyDef is all about flexibility. As such, it is difficult to describe what MyDef is and what it can do. Last section gives a quick glimpse, but may not be enough to persuade you to try MyDef or read the rest of this book, especially if you are not a c programmer, or simply not interested in simple hello world programs.

Don't worry about not understanding the examples especially if you are not familiar with the underlying language or application. Simply browse through and let your mind on autopilot to generate the impressions for you.
