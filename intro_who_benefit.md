# What to expect

MyDef is not a programming language. 

A programming language is a rather low level construct, mainly catering toward machines. As such, its unit of structures are rather inflexible. 

On the other hand, our mind works on a semantic level, whose structures are quite fluid. We can think about a wheel, and we can think about a material, both quite independently. To our mind, we seperate them when we study them seperately, but we can also mix them when we need put them together. This kind of behavior is hard to define in a rigid programing language. 

MyDef is a meta layer that tries to cater toward how our mind works. MyDef does not intrisically respect the syntax of underlying programming language. Its fundamental model simply treat the source code as plain text. Therefore, MyDef can better focus on realizing our semantic structrures.

But don't get it wrong, it is not one or the other. Our mind can easily shift focus back and forth between higher level semantic structure and lower level language constructs. We can program directly in assembly language as well as Basic, and Java. One is easier than the other depend on the degree that our mind need to bend. However, none of the programming language can reach a level what I would call "What you see is what you think" (WYSIWYT). MyDef aims at WYSIWYT.
