# What to expect

MyDef is not a programming language. 

A programming language is a rather low level construct, mainly catering toward machines. As such, its unit of structures are rather inflexible. 

On the other hand, our mind works on a semantic level, whose structures are quite fluid. We can think about a wheel, and we can think about a material, both quite independently. To our mind, we seperate them when we study them seperately, but we can also mix them when we need put them together. This kind of behavior is hard to define in a rigid programing language. 

MyDef is a meta layer that tries to cater toward how our mind works. MyDef does not intrisically respect the syntax of underlying programming language. Its fundamental model simply treat the source code as plain text. Therefore, MyDef can better focus on realizing our semantic structrures.

But don't get it wrong, it is not one or the other. Our mind can easily shift focus back and forth between higher level semantic structure and lower level language constructs. In MyDef, the underlying language is still there, not much interfered, our mind have no problem to focus on the language syntax if we choose to. And when we are experienced and confident with the language syntax stuff, we can and would prefer to work at higher semantic level. MyDef shall help you on that.
